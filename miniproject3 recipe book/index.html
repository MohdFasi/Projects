                    <summary><b>Instructions to prepare</b></summary>
                    <p>Here is a recipe for **chicken biryani** that you can try: <br>

                        1. Marinate half kg chicken with 3 tablespoons plain yogurt, 1Â¼ tablespoons ginger garlic paste, Â½ to 1 tablespoon garam masala (or biriyani masala), Â½ teaspoon salt, Â¼ teaspoon ground turmeric, Â½ to 1 teaspoon red chili powder (reduce for kids), and 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Cover and set aside for 1 hour. <br>
                        
                        2. Meanwhile, rinse 2 cups basmati rice at least thrice. Drain and soak in fresh water for 30 minutes. Drain to a colander after 30 minutes. <br>
                        
                        3. Heat ghee or oil in a heavy bottom pot or pressure cooker. Add thinly sliced onions and fry them on medium heat until uniformly light brown. <br>
                        
                        4. Add marinated chicken and sautÃ© until it becomes pale for 5 minutes. <br>
                         
                        5. Lower the flame completely. Cover and cook until the chicken is soft, tender, and completely cooked. <br>
                        
                        6. Check if the chicken is cooked by pricking with a fork or knife. It has to be just cooked and not overdone. <br>
                        
                        7. Add the par-cooked rice to the pot followed by herbs, saffron-infused milk & ghee. <br>
                        
                        8. Cover the pot with a tight lid and cook on low heat until the rice is done. <br>
                        
                        9. Serve hot with raita, shorba, lassi, and papads. <br>
                        
                        This recipe yields a chicken biryani that isnâ€™t too oily, spicy, hot or pungent as it looks to be in the pictures Â¹. However, you can reduce the amount of red chili powder if you do not prefer the heat Â¹.
                        
                      <br>  Enjoy your meal! ðŸ˜Š</p>

                <p>If youâ€™re a fan of bread and potatoes, youâ€™re going to love this Punjabi Aloo Paratha or Aloo ka Paratha. Sometimes spelled Alu Paratha, this potato stuffed flatbread is a popular Indian breakfast that combines two of my favorite starches in a single delectable package. Crisp on the outside and tender on the inside, this humble meal is as comforting as a hug. Whatâ€™s not to love?                </p>
